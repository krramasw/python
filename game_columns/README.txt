Project Description


Design and Implementation approach

    We are following iterative approach to design and implementation.  We will start defining object/modules and dummy interfaces and keep adding feature in each iteration.
    For this project, there are total of 7 iterations. Please look in to each iteration sub directory for more details

    After iteration 0 (Analyis and Design), Columns_Game_High_Level_Design_And_Planning.pptx will be updated in this directory with plan for each iteration.
