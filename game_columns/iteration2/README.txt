Iteration 2 Implementation summary


        In this iteration, we have implemented

                print_state()
                run()
                process_user_input()

                of CliUi.py


        You would start seeing the CliUi output properly and the Jewels not yet moving.



How to Run ?

        cd to ./iteration1 directory

        python run_cli.py

        enter "TEST" as the mode

        now run_cli.py will simulate steps for actions ["F 3 X Y Z", "F 2 S S Z", "F 1 A B Z"]

        You will see the state of Grid getting dumped
